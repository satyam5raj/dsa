# Core Data Structures
* These are building blocks — make sure you can implement and use them:

1. Arrays

Basics: push, pop, shift, unshift, splice

2D arrays

Two pointers, Sliding window, prefix sum, subarrays

2. Strings

String manipulation

Substrings, anagrams, palindromes

3. Linked Lists

Singly linked list

Doubly linked list

Circular linked list

4. Stacks

Using arrays

Using linked lists

Real-world: undo feature, expression evaluation

5. Queues

Simple queue

Circular queue

Deque (double-ended queue)

Priority queue (using heap)

6. Hash Tables (Objects & Maps)

Hash functions

Collision resolution

Frequency counting

LRU cache (advanced)

7. Trees

Binary Trees

Binary Search Trees (BST)

AVL Trees / Balanced Trees

Tree traversals (DFS, BFS)

Trie (Prefix Tree)

8. Graphs

Adjacency list/matrix

BFS and DFS

Shortest path (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)

Topological sort

Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

9. Heaps

Min Heap / Max Heap

Priority Queue

Heap sort

10. Sets and Maps (ES6)

Set operations (intersection, union, difference)

Map for caching/frequency counting
